<h1 class="top">Prospective Students</h1>
<h2 id = "skype">Now accepting Skype students!</h2>
<div class="container">

	<div>
	
		<p>As a courtesy, I invite all of my prospective students to observe a lesson to make sure that we will be a good teacher/student fit. Please contact me to schedule a time to observe (in person or via Skype); however, observations are not required.</p>
		<p>Please see the "About Me" section for information about my credentials and philosophy.</p>
		<p>Please read below for my studio policy and rates.</p>
		<p>I welcome all questions, comments, and concerns.</p>
	
<h1>Lessons</h1>

		<p>I have 16 years experience teaching viola, violin, and piano, teaching ages 3 and above, beginning to advanced students.</p>
					<p>I'm trained in the Suzuki Method for violin and viola, Pre-Twinkle through Book 3, though I'm quite comfortable with traditional methods as well.</p>
			<p>I'm available to give lessons in either my home or yours, in person or online.</p>

<h3 id="skype-header">Skype Lessons</h3>
<!-- <div class = "skype-ruler"><hr></div> -->
		<p>I have over two years experience teaching Skype lessons (violin, viola, piano) to people around the world. Most recently, I've also begun teaching in an English immersion program to children in China, which has been immensely helpful in developing the particular skill-set required to teach online. </p>
		<p>However, Skype lessons aren't for everyone. Certain things must be considered in deciding what the best course of action is for the student. I assess each family individually, but the following points may be helpful in determining whether Skype or in-person lessons are the best fit for you.</p>
		<p>Skype lessons are ideal for:
			<ul>
<li>Adults, any instrument</li>
<li>Teenagers (10 years and older), any instrument (assuming they're motivated)</li>
<li>Students 7 - 9 years old with optional parent/practice partner, piano</li>
<li>Students 7-9 years old with parent, violin/viola</li>
<li>Students 3 - 7 years old with parent, piano</li>
<li>Sudents 3 - 7 years old with parent, strings (if parent has prior string playing experience OR is willing to take a month of lessons before introducing student to box violin.</li>
			</ul>
<br>
<h3 id="suzuki">Suzuki Lessons</h3>
<p>For children younger than 8 years old wanting to learn violin, I recommend that they start with the Suzuki method. One of the tenants of the Suzuki philosophy is parent involvement in the child's practice. From a developmental standpoint, the vast majority of children below the age of 8 need the critical thinking skills of their practice partner in order to be successful at learning the violin. I reccommend that every parent interested in beginning Suzuki violin lessons read "Nurtured by Love" by Shinichi Suzuki and research the Suzuki method before enrolling their child. The Suzuki Method requires a strong commitment on the part of the parent and the child; while sometimes challenging, those that rise to meet the challenge are greatly rewarded.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.suzukimusic.org.au/phil.htm#phil" target="_blank">Suzuki Talent Education Association of Australia (Victoria) Inc</a> has more in-depth information. You can also <a href="mailto:erikagreen7777@gmail.com?Subject=website%20inquiry" target="_top">contact me</a> with further questions.</p>


<h1>Studio Policy</h1>

			<p>Private Lessons are given weekly in 15, 30, 45 and 60 minute lengths. Private lessons focus primarily on technique and repertoire as well as musicianship and creative problem-solving/practice skills. Dr. Suzuki is often quoted as saying that lessons help to build a child's overall character as well.</p>

	<h2>Practice</h2>
<hr>
			<p>Regular home practice is essential for student success. Ideally, students should aim for at least 5 days of practice each week for the same length of time as your lesson.</p>
			<p>Short, daily practice sessions are more effective than one or two long sessions per week. The most important time for students to practice is right after their weekly lesson, to solidify what they have just learned. Research has shown that retention of new knowledge drops to 60% after just 24 hours.</p>
			<p>Parental involvement in home practice is crucial for student success. Please help your student establish and stick to a practice routine, and see that practice time is free of distractions.</p>
			<p>It is imperative that the parent available during the lesson is also available during practice time to make sure that the student is practicing correctly!</p>

	<h2>Attendance</h2>
<hr>
			<p>Students are expected to attend each scheduled week of the year. When you register for lessons, your timeslot is reserved for you for the teaching year. Please keep in mind that my studio operates at full capacity and make-ups for missed lessons are not guaranteed.</p>
			<p><strong>No refunds will be given for missed lessons.</strong>In the event that your student needs to miss a lesson because of a conflict or illness, please contact me with as much advance notice as possible (at least 24 hours for non-emergency/illness situations). Each family is responsible for contacting me to reserve an available make-up time.</p>
			<p>After three (3) unexcused absences, I reserve the right to remove the student(s) from my studio. An unexcused absence is defined as not providing 24 hours' notice before an absence. In the case of illness or family emergency, the 24 hours' notice policy is waived.</p>
			<p>Any lessons missed by the instructor due to illness, emergency, or performance will be rescheduled as soon as possible.</p>
			<p>Please be prompt - <strong>lesson times cannot be extended for students who arrive late.</strong></p>
			<p>Summer lessons are scheduled on a by-the-lesson basis. Students should expect to continue lessons on at least a part-time schedule through the summer to maintain the skills they develop through the school year. Students who do not enroll for summer lessons are not guaranteed a spot in the studio for the next year.</p>	

	<h2>Equipment</h2>
<hr>
		<p>All students must have their own instrument for home practice. The quality of your student's home instrument plays a significant role in their potential for success.</p>
		<p>Students are required to purchase their own materials, which includes a notebook and any necessary music/equipment. Students must bring their instrument, music, and notebook to each lesson.</p>

	<h2>Tuition</h2>	
<hr>
		<p>Tuition is based on a 9 month (September through June) school year, which has been calculated to include two weeks of winter break and one week of Thanksgiving break (tuition rates won't change those months). Students are expected to sign up for 6 lessons throughout the summer (June-August) in order to retain their spot in the studio. Scheduling and payment for the summer will be decided before the end of May.</p>
		<p>Students should plan to commit to lessons for the full school year. If unforeseen circumstances require a student to terminate lessons mid-year, one month's paid, written notice is required to end lessons.</p>

	<h2>Payment</h2>
<hr>
		<p>Payment is due the first lesson of the month in cash, check, or PayPal.There will be no lesson taught if payment is not received. If tuition is paid after the first week of the month a $15 late fee will be added. If you would rather pay in two semesterly payments please let me know and I'll make sure that you receive a discount.</p>
		<p>A $35 fee will be imposed on all returned checks.</p>

<h1>Rates</h1>
<p>
    The following rates are monthly and remain the same, regardless of how many weeks are in a particular month. I've calculated these rates based on a 36-week teaching year over the course of 9 months. Please be aware that there will be no lessons the week of Thanksgiving, Christmas, or New Year's (tuition has been calculated accordingly). 
</p>
<p>Please note that $40 (per month) will be added to the below rates if I am traveling to you. This pays for my gas and time to come to your home. However, if there are multiple students at one location, then only one gas fee will be billed.</p>
<p>
    I also offer discounts for family lessons (more than one person in a family receiving lessons) and homeschoolers that take a lesson during normal school hours (8 am-3 pm).  For information on group classes, please <a href="#">contact me</a>.
